The expression tested was \\(1 \\times (13 - 1 - 1)\\), which resulted in 11, not 24.\n3. **Action Steps 2 through 8:** We continued to attempt generating and testing various combinations using the same tool but encountered issues with the syntax, leading to errors such as \"unexpected indent.\"\n\n### Answer:\nAfter reviewing the possible combinations and encountering errors with the tool, we can manually derive a correct expression. One valid expression that uses the numbers [1, 1, 1, 13] exactly once and equals 24 is:\n\\[\n(1 + 1 + 1) \\times 13 = 24\n\\]"
