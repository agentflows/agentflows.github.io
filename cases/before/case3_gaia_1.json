Additionally, while the information provided is from a reliable source (the YouTube video itself), it would be beneficial to cross-reference this with other sources to ensure accuracy.\n\nTo address these gaps, we can use the **Web_RAG_Search_Tool** to find more information about the video and the year of the interview.

However, the video did not provide specific details regarding the prediction.\n2. **Second Action:** A broader search was conducted to find the name of the scientist who predicted the sooner development of thinking machines or robots. The search revealed that Jerome B. Wiesner, a co-host of the video, made such a prediction.\n3. **Third Action:** Further investigation was needed to determine the exact year of the interview in the video. The search indicated that Jerome Wiesner made his prediction in 1960, as part of a CBS series called \"Tomorrow\" that aired on October 26, 1960.\n4. **Fourth Action:** Additional searches confirmed that Jerome Wiesner was indeed one of the scientists featured in the video and that he predicted the development of thinking machines or robots within 4 to 5 years.\n\n### Answer:\nFirst name Last name: Jerome B.
